<!-- BEGIN ANVIL -->
This repository uses [Anvil](https://github.com/rjwalters/anvil) for AI-powered artifact creation. See `.anvil/CLAUDE.md` for the full guide (skills, rubric, state machine). To upgrade Anvil, re-run `install-anvil.sh .` from the anvil checkout without `--skills=` to pick up newly-shipped skills; pass `--skills=...` only to install a strict subset.
In Claude Code, invoke an installed skill via `/anvil:<skill>` (e.g. `/anvil:paper-draft <slug>`) -- the per-skill registration shim lives at `.claude/skills/anvil-<skill>/`.
<!-- END ANVIL -->

<!-- BEGIN REPO-SKILLS -->
This repository has [Repo Skills](https://github.com/rjwalters/repo) v0.21.5 installed —
general repository hygiene and environment commands invoked as `/repo:<command>`. Run
`/repo:help` for the command list, or see `.claude/skills/repo/SKILL.md` for the full
guide. Hygiene commands apply safe, reversible fixes by default and report each
change; run with `--ask` to review first, and `--prune` to allow irreversible
removals. Managed by `install.sh` — edit outside the markers only.
<!-- END REPO-SKILLS -->

<!-- BEGIN LOOM ORCHESTRATION -->
This repository uses [Loom](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom) for AI-powered development orchestration — see the Loom repository for the full guide (roles, labels, worktrees, configuration). When installed, Loom also writes a locally-substituted copy of that guide to `.loom/CLAUDE.md`.

Work is coordinated through `loom:` labels on issues and pull requests, and the same roles run either under `loom-daemon` or by hand in an attended session — daemon mode is optional. Create the labels once with `.loom/scripts/sync-labels.sh` (an install ships `.github/labels.yml` but does not create the labels on the forge). A pull request ready for review carries `loom:review-requested`; Judge reviews it and applies `loom:pr` (approved) or `loom:changes-requested`; Doctor fixes a `loom:changes-requested` pull request and returns it to `loom:review-requested`. Only a `loom:pr` pull request gets merged, and always via this repo's merge script (`.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh`) — never a raw forge merge command such as `gh pr merge`. Full state machine: `.loom/docs/label-state-machine.md`.
